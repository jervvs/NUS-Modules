# NUS Modules AY20/21 Semester 1

Compilation of all labs, assignments and other coding I did during my SUSEP exchange in NUS 

## CS3210 - Parallel Computing

This module provided an introduction to the field of parallel computing with hands-on parallel programming experience on real parallel machines. This included everything from memory architecture, computation models and parallel performance.

**_Assignment 1_** - Compared sequential implementation of longest common subsequence problem against parallel implementations (processes, threads and OMP).

**_Assignment 2_** - Parallelised hash-based proof-of-work system using CUDA.

## CS3230 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms

This module introduces different techniques of designing and analysing algorithms. It covers lower and upper bounds, recurrences, basic algorithm paradigms (such as prune-and-search, dynamic programming, greedy, branch-and-bound, graph traversal, and randomised approaches), amortized analysis, NP-completeness, and some selected advanced topics.

## QF5210 - Financial Time Series Theory and Computation

This module discusses econometrics methods and models that are appropriate for understanding, analysing and solving financial problems. It provided hands-on experience with financial data and learn about regression analysis, time series analysis, multivariate statistical methods and their applications to capital asset pricing, volatility analysis and forecast, risk management and trading strategy.

**_Project_** - Compared different statistical models (ARIMA, GARCH, MSGARCH) and used forecasts to construct different portfolios (Equal Weight, Max Sharpe) which outperformed baseline S&P500, obtaining A for the module.
